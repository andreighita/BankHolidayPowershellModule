# BankHoliday PowerShell Module

BankHoliday is a Windows PowerShell module that can be used tp add, remove, or list bank holiday entries from mailboxes. The module uses the EWS Managed API 2.2 to connect to mailboxes, in conjunction with MSAL.Net for OAuth authentication. 

**IMPORTANT** The current version of the module was tested against Microsoft 365 (Exchange Online) maioboxes only. It is not guaranteed to work against on premises mailboxes. 

The current version of the module exports 4 functions:
- Add-BankHoliday
- Get-BankHoliday
- Remove-BankHoliday
- Get-CountryNames

As the name suggests, *Add-BankHoliday* can be used to add bank holidays to mailboxes, *Get-BankHoliday* can be used to list bank holidays in mailboxes, and *Remove-BankHoliday* can be used to remove bank holidays from mailboxes. 

# Installing the module

To install the module, run Windows PowerShell and run the following command to list the paths to the PowerShell module folders in your system:
```sh
$env:PSModulePath -split ';'
```

You should see a result similar to:

```sh
C:\Users\User1\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```

Download and extract the contents of the [v1.0 release](https://github.com/andreighita/BankHolidayPowershellModule/files/5972306/BankHoliday_v1.0.zip) into one of the folders listed above. 
If you want the module to be available to the current user only, then extract the archive content into the *C:\Users* location, alternatively, use one of the otehr folders to make the module available to everyone logged on to the system.
